This project focuses on a comparative analysis of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for regression tasks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification tasks. The goal is to evaluate the performance of both models using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error. The project involves training a regression model using ANN on a continuous dataset and a classification model using CNN on an image dataset. The results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, with ANN performing well in regression tasks, while CNN excels in image classification. This analysis also highlights key findings, such as the importance of data preprocessing, regularization, and optimization techniques in enhancing model performance.
